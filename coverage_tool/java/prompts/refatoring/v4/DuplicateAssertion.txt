Let's start step by step. First, this test code contains a test smell known as "Duplicate Assert", which occurs when a test method contains more than one assertion statement with the same parameters. Second, I need a version of this code that keeps the same test's intention but mitigates this smell. 
One approach involves understanding why these assertions are being called on multiple lines, and replacing the variable assignments used with more descriptive names suitable for this test code.

An one-shot example is provided to you to be used as a reference:

Example 1:
<Provided test code>
```
class SubpageTestCase:

    def test_checksum(self):
        p = Subpage()
        self.assertEqual(57917, p.checksum)
        p = Subpage(prefill=True)
        self.assertEqual(57917, p.checksum)
```
<Refactored test code>
```
class SubpageTestCase:

    def test_checksum(self):
        p1 = Subpage()
	p2 = Subpage(prefill=True)
        self.assertEqual(57917, p1.checksum)
        self.assertEqual(57917, p2.checksum)
```

Now provide the refactored test code for the code below, delimited by triple backticks.
Attention: Preserve all existing import statements in the Java code. You may introduce new packages as needed.
